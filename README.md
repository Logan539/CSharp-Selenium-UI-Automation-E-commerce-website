In this project, I am trying to work on http://tutorialsninja.com/demo/index.php?route=product/category&path=20 site.

In first method, I am pulling all the products that are present on above url. Gathering details like product name, its price, its product code, its discounted price. For passing quantity here, I am using an list which inturn add this to input excel.

In 2nd method, I use that excel to add all possible products which can be added to cart and on cart I am performing verifications such as verifying unit price, total price (unit price * quantity) and quantity present on it.
